Be Safe - (Every life saved counts) 

The application would be used to manage natural disasters. We would be dividing the application based on the user mode. We would be introducing three types of users. 

RELIEF TEAM 
1. Register in the app about the location of the rescue centre
2. Be alerted of the occurence of a natural disaster in prior using weather forecast information 
3. Notify unsafe users about the rescue centre closest to their area
4. Manage inventory for a particular rescue centre
5. Notify Goverment relief funds managing organizations if they require further funds or inventory for a particular rescue centre

UNSAFE USER 
1. Register in the app with information about the location of rescue needed
2. Can view the rescue teams available closest to their area
3. Can notify only one of the rescue centres to provide help
4. Can view Government related schemes which can provide help in case of collateral damage (life loss/ property loss)

SAFE USER
1. Mostly the major loss that happens after a disaster, which we feel, is when people(especially lower class) become homeless which leads to major need of employment.
2. So, if there is a way out, where even the safe people can help the unsafe people, then it can give birth to deeper sense for humanities among masses
