Be Safe - (Every life saved counts) 

The application can be used to manage natural disasters. 
Application will be divided based on the user mode.
There will be three types of users: Safe, Unsafe and Rescue team.

Mostly the major loss that happens after a disaster is when people(uspecially lower class) become homeless which leads to major need of employment which led us to introduce the safe user mode apart from the unsafe user and relief team user.


RESCUE TEAM USER
1. Register in the app about the location of the rescue centre
2. Be alerted of the occurence of a natural disaster in prior using weather forecast information 
3. Notify unsafe users about the rescue centre closest to their area
4. Manage inventory for a particular rescue centre
5. Notify Goverment relief funds managing organizations if they require further funds or inventory for a particular rescue centre

UNSAFE USER 
1. Register in the app with information about the location of rescue needed
2. Can view the rescue teams available closest to their area
3. Can notify only one of the rescue centres to ask for help
4. Can view Government related schemes which can provide help in case of collateral damage (life loss/ property loss)

SAFE USER
1. Register in the app with information about the location 
2. Can provide information of basic necessities if available with them to rescue centres
3. Can provide employment opportunity for unsafe users if available via the rescue centre
